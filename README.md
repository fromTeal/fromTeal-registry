# fromTeal-registry
If you've ever taken part in a hackathon, you probably experienced how effective, productive, creative, and joyful the work was. It just felt alive. Why? Your team was building something you actually cared about, on your own terms, with full accountability and freedom for each team member. You weren't a human resource but a human: able to show up as your actual self and work with a group of people you were excited to be with.

It's not just about being more effective — we believe spending the biggest part of your day engaging your skills and passion creating things that matter with amazing colleagues is a fundamental part of self-actualization.

Helping you do this and build a successful business around it is why we started fromTeal: an organization founded by engineers trying to experiment with ways to replace the existing model. You can find more details [here](idea.md).

Our first project is a registry of teams and their purpose - the problem they want to solve - which we hope will help engineers discover one another and join forces. As we go, we will provide the other tools/structure we are building to the community that's forming here. 

We believe work should be meaningful, organic, effective, creative, motivated, beautiful, and fun. We're building an inspired community of makers — list your project or connect with one of the teams below today!
