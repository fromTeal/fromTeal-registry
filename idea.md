Eighty percent of people worldwide [report](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace-2022-report.aspx) feeling disengaged at work.
 
We rent our time and energy to pay the mortgage — dragging our feet through lifeless work processes, drained by the meetings and petulant hallway talk that inevitably follows.
 
People don't own what they do or the way they do it. We feel deflated.
 
But everyone knows they're capable of more than that.  

Maybe you're here because the VCs who owned your last company told them to hire like crazy and manufacture hypergrowth in 2021 decided to "go defensive" (sack everyone) in 2023. Maybe you worked in big tech and the story was similar. Was it ever about the product? Were the people just inputs the whole time? 

There's something fundamentally broken here. These companies were started by engineers trying to create something meaningful and solve real problems. But soon enough they hand the keys over to money men and management who sterilize the project, toss the original purpose, and turn all focus to make the company as presentable to investors as possible so they can get out for more than they got in. Optimize for valuation optics, not great products — a value strip-mine.

These companies wouldn't exist without engineers setting up shop and building the actual products. We don't need the middle management. We don’t need the VCs.

If you've ever taken part in a hackathon, you probably experienced how effective, productive, creative, and joyful the work was. It just felt alive. Why? Your team was building something you actually cared about, on your own terms, with full accountability and freedom for each team member. You weren't a human resource but a human: able to show up as your actual self and work with a group of people you were excited to be with.

It's not just about being more effective — we believe spending the biggest part of your day engaging your skills and passion creating things that matter with amazing colleagues is a fundamental part of self-actualization.

Helping you do this and build a successful business around it is why we started [fromTeal](http://www.fromteal.com/): an organization founded by engineers trying to experiment with ways to replace the existing model.
 
We were inspired by a totally different organizational approach based on radically different core assumptions about people. There're many names for this, but the most popular is called the Teal Organization. In short, this means working transparently as a bottom-up emergent organization. No stodgy processes, no middle management, no information withholding or distrust from the top. People show up as their actual selves, without a mask of professionalism and wet-towel business language. They own what they do and rise to the task because of it.
 
There's a lot to say on the topic, but a simple analogy is the difference between a centrally planned economy and a free society, or a forest ecosystem and a complex machine. People who work like this tend to love it and are far more effective than in the top-down structure. You can watch this 30m [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GlG_ESETgo&feature=youtu.be) as a starting point to learn more.
 
Beyond organizational structure, fromTeal will be helping teams manage equity, create decision making/consensus tools, bootstrap community when relevant, and more. But our first step is a registry of teams and their purpose - the problem they want to solve - which we hope will help engineers discover one another and join forces. As we go, we will provide tools/structure we are building to the community that's forming here. 

We believe work should be meaningful, organic, effective, creative, inspired, beautiful, and fun. We're building an inspired community of makers, join today!
